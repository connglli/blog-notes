# Notes ✍️

This is a collection of my own notes ✍️ (goto [Issues](https://github.com/clixyz/blog-notes/issues)). Opinions are also my own 😆. Or, check out to [my website](https://connglli.github.io).

### 🏡 Topics

Topics are various, but,
+ `programming languages` and `virtual machines`,
+ `android` and `aosp`, 
+ `browsers` and `web`, 
+ and other micellaneous ones (few).

### 🚦Attention

You'd bettern know before reading them,
+ Some of them are accomplished, but some of are not (they are tagged with `todo`; for these, I either know little about them, or not well prepared to write them down in a logical and structural manner)
+ Some of them are my personal thoughts, but some of them are learned or borrowed directly from others (but I've put references)
+ Take your own risk

### 🤝 Welcome

Last but not least, I'm learning as you are. So discussions are very much welcome. Let me know if you have any comments, suggestions, questions, or even **corrections**. Please directly make comments under the issues that you are interested.
